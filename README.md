# sqlizer
JAVA library to perform OOP SQL queries

## Configuration

Currently SQLizer is only accessible from Git. This is why you'll need to add [Jitpack](https://jitpack.io/) to your repository list.

``` XML
<repository>
   <id>jitpack.io</id>
   <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
</repository>
```

Then you can reference SQLizer as one of your dependency in your `pom.xml` file:

``` XML
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.pierrelemee</groupId>
    <artifactId>sqlizer</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.2</version>
</dependency>
```

and you're good to go
